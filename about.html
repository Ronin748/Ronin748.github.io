	<b>About Roninkoi</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	I'm Roninkoi/Ronin748/Ron..., a hobbyist game dev from Finland. I've been making small silly games off and on for the past +5 years. Most of these have been for game jams such as Ludum Dare. In addition to game design, game technology has interested me for a long time, so I've always written my own game engines. Graphics programming holds a special place in my heart.
	<br>
	<br>
	My current interests are in physics simulations, which was insipired by my own attempts at making game physics for my engines. I'm hoping to get a degree in computational physics. Some of my favorite areas include materials physics, fluid dynamics, orbital mechanics, semiconductors, medical physics and computer science of course.
	<br>
	<br>
	While I'm not an expert in anything I do, I dabble in art and hardware as well. I do the art for my games and I hoard musical instruments, for what it's worth. I'm a big fan of older computers and electronics in general.
	<br>
	<br>
Other:
	<br>
	CPU architectures, MIPS, RISC in general
	<br>
	Older computer hardware, especially 60s mainframes and 90s UNIX workstations
	<br>
	Retrogaming
	<br>
	Aerospace engineering, astronomy
	<br>
	Nuclear physics, radiation detection, radiochemistry
